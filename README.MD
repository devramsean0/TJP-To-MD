# TJP-TO-MD
A CLI tool to take the markdown generated by Typedoc JSON Parser and turn it into Markdown Files

## Reasoning
* MD files is easier to display on a site than a specialised JSON file.
* Using ESM only modules with next has caused me issues in the past.
* Allows for viewing within GitHub / Any Markdown Viewer
* Allows projects to copy relevant parts of documentation easier
