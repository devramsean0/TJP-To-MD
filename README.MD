# TJP-TO-MD
A CLI tool to take the markdown generated by [Typedoc JSON Parser](https://npmjs.com/package/typedoc-json-parser) and turn it into Markdown Files

## Reasoning
* MD files is easier to display on a site than a specialised JSON file.
* Using ESM only modules with next has caused me issues in the past.
* Allows for viewing within GitHub / Any Markdown Viewer
* Allows projects to copy relevant parts of documentation easier

## Configuration:
The CLI can be configured by placing a `tjp_to_md.toml` file into the root of the fiolder where the parsing will happen.
This should look like:
```toml
input_dir= "<your input directory>"
output_dir = "<your output directory>"
max_threads = 5
regen_all = false
```

Alternatively, you can run `tjp-to-md gen_config`
